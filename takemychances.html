<P>&ldquo; <FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">I
understand that you may feel that way and a lot of people I <BR><BR>speak
with feel the exact same way until they realized how <BR><BR>expensive
just one repair on your car is. &ldquo;</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR>&ldquo;
<SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">Do you happen to know how much it
is just for one hour of</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">labor?</SPAN>
&ldquo;<BR><BR>**********************************</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR>&ldquo;
That's ok, right now in your area labor rates are at $135 an hour
<BR>with 4-hour minimum. &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo; That's $540 just
in labor! &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;The diagnostic test <I>(just for
them to look at it)</I> costs $125. &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;If you
have a small repair like an alternator or water pump its <BR><BR>$297
for a brand new one, and you do want new parts to put in <BR><BR>your
car right?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR>***********************************<BR><BR>&ldquo;Now,
you're at $962 plus taxes (7.5%). &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;After
taxes the total cost is going to be $1,034.15 just for a <BR><BR>minor
repair. &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo; Your policy per year only averages
(avg/yr) and if you have one <BR><BR>computer repair throughout the
(#years of policy) your policy <BR><BR>pays for itself.<BR><BR><BR>Do
you feel like as your car gets older and higher in mileage that <BR><BR>you
are less likely to break down? &ldquo;<BR><BR>**********************************</FONT></P>
<P>&ldquo; <FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Besides,
when you bought the car did they tell you that it was <BR><BR>guaranteed
to never break down on you? &ldquo;</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR><BR>&ldquo;
That's because it's a fact that cars do breakdown. Even brand-<BR><BR>new
cars. &ldquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR><BR>&ldquo;And
the question that you have to ask yourself is that when you <BR><BR>do
have problems do you want to be able to budget it over a <BR><BR>monthly
basis or take the hit all at once? &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR><BR>&ldquo; I
would like to think that you would want to budget it out over
<BR><BR>monthly payments.&ldquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR><BR>&ldquo;
Besides, most of your vehicle is electronically controlled. &ldquo;</FONT></P>

What are you doing to prevent electrical issues? &ldquo;<BR></FONT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">**********************************<BR><BR>&ldquo;Exactly,
So, if you can't prevent electrical problems then the <BR><BR>only
thing you can do is prepare for them.<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;And the way
that you do that is by keeping protection on your <BR><BR>vehicle! &ldquo;
<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;All that is due today is the down payment and I
went ahead and <BR><BR>set you up on (# of payments) and you can do
that on a Visa, <BR><BR>Mastercard, Amex, or Discover.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
