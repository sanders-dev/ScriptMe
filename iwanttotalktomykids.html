completely understand! </SPAN></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">You're very fortunate to have
your kids around to help you with these sort of things.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR>Are they available now to
talk to?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">***** (no) *****</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR>Do they live with you?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR>Again, as I mentioned
before, you are very fortunate to have your <BR>kids to help you with
these sort of things. <BR><BR><BR>Let me ask you, <SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">who
normally takes the vehicle in for oil changes?</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR>***** (I do) *****</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR>Okay, so you take it in
for oil changes and you pay for the oil <BR>changes correct? <BR><BR><BR>*****
(let them answer) *****</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR><BR>And <SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">if
the vehicle ends up having an issue, who would be the one <BR>taking
it in to the repair shop and paying for the repair?</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR><BR>***** (I will) *****</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR><BR><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">&ldquo;
So, at the end of the day whatever happens to this vehicle <BR><BR>you&rsquo;d
be the one who would have to pay to have it fixed, </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">maintained,
or even if you needed new tires, </SPAN></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">you
would be the one paying for it! &ldquo;</SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>You're
lucky to have people advising you, <BR><BR>but <SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">when
this vehicle breaks down your kid is not going to the <BR><BR>one
that has to pay for it out of their pocket, you are</SPAN>! </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR>So ultimate because this
is your vehicle, <BR><BR>and the vehicle is your fiduciary
responsibility the decision is actually yours to make.<BR></FONT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR>Because even if your son
or daughter advises you not to get the coverage,</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">if something breaks down on
this vehicle you're still going to be the one </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">that&rsquo;s writing a check
to the mechanic </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">and when you do have a
problem and when you are writing the check </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR><BR><BR>I'd like to think
that you would want to write him a $100 check </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">rather than standing there
with a blank check in your hand signed </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">and letting them fill it out
right?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Story: A couple months ago I
had a lady in the same situation who wanted to talk to her son. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Her son advised her not to
get the coverage, and two weeks ago I got a call from both her and
her son. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">She was in tears because her
card needed a new computer module it was going to cost her $2800. </FONT>

<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">because her son advised her
not to get the coverage he felt obligated to pay for the repair. </FONT>
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Well she knew that he could
not afford to pay for it and was begging me to be able to put
coverage on her vehicle. </FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">It broke my heart but there
was nothing that I could do. </FONT>
