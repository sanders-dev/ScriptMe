<BR><BR><BR><BR>&ldquo; I got caught up in that mess and my credit
card company called <BR><BR>me before I even noticed the transaction
on the statement. It was <BR><BR>very simple process, they asked me
if I had been to one of the <BR><BR>stores I told them no, not for a
long time, they advised me to cut <BR><BR>that card up and had
another one overnighted out to me. It was a <BR><BR>very simple
process. &ldquo;</FONT></P>
