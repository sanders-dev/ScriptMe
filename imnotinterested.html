Most people that I speak to with a (age of car) get the coverage.</SPAN></FONT></P>

That's ok, <SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">right now in your area
labor rates are at $135 an hour <BR>with 4-hour minimum</SPAN>. &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;
That's $540 just in labor! &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;The diagnostic
test <I>(just for them to look at it)</I> costs $125. &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;If
you have a small repair like an alternator or water pump its <BR><BR>$297
for a brand new one, and you do want new parts to put in <BR><BR>your
car right?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR>***********************************<BR><BR>&ldquo;Now,
you're at $962 plus taxes (7.5%). &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;After
taxes the total cost is going to be $1,034.15 just for a <BR><BR>minor
repair. &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo; Your policy per year only averages
(avg/yr) and if you have one <BR><BR>computer repair throughout the

do like the level of coverage I discussed with you, correct? <BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;And
remember you are getting towing, roadside, and a rental <BR><BR>anytime
your vehicle is in the shop.&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;With
labor rates being as high as they are, unless you have <BR><BR>$3,000
that you could kiss goodbye. &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR><BR>&ldquo; It would
probably be a good idea to keep the vehicle protected <BR><BR>because
as it gets older and accumulates more mileage it will <BR><BR>become
a higher liability. &ldquo;<BR><BR><BR>&ldquo;One thing that the
policy will allow you to do is make monthly <BR><BR>payments and &ndash;
<BR><BR>I guarantee that when you break down the dealership is not
going <BR><BR>to let you make monthly payments on the repair work.
&ldquo;<BR><BR><BR><BR>&ldquo; They will hand you a $3000 invoice and
ask you what card to <BR><BR>put it on &ndash; </FONT>
